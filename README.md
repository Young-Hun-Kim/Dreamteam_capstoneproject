# Project Title

Develop a Machine Learning Model to Detect Human Activity by Using Wearable Devices

## Introduction

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to detect human activity using wearable devices. The model will use data from accelerometers in the wearable devices to identify various activities such as walking, running, sitting, standing, and up/downstairs. The model can be used in various applications such as health monitoring, fitness tracking, and sports performance analysis.

## Technologies

The project will be developed using the following technologies:

- Python
- TensorFlow??
- Keras??
- Scikit-learn??
- Jupyter Notebook??

## Installation

To install the required libraries, run the following command:??? need to add this part




## Dataset

The model will be trained on the WISDOM Dataset, which is a publicly available dataset containing accelerometer data for various activities.
